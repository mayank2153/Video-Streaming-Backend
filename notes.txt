we create the .gitkeep(public/temp) file to get the files tracked by git

to connect the db, we had first created a cluster on mongodb and installed express mongoose and dotenv in our project.
we have made a mongodb connection function inside index.js in db folder which will be used to connect to the database.
we will call this function in the entry point of our app i.e. index.js in src folder

the connection function of the mongodb is an async function.
to have dotenv in our project , we need to call it by using require but we have used import to call it, thats why we have added -r flag in our dev script to make our app know that it should have to call dotenv/config in starting and we have also added --experimental-json-modules in our dev script to call dotenv/ by import
